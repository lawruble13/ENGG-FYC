# ENGG-FYC
Schulich Engineering Companion App

I intend for this app to be a useful companion app for first year University of Calgary Engineering students. To this end, 
it will include general information, formulae, solvers (where applicable), etc. Suggestions are welcome.

Any solvers in this app should NOT be used in place of doing the calculations yourself, the hope is that they will act as a useful 
tool for checking your answers.

Disabled courses are in italics in the main menu.
